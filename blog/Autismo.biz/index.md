### Launch of New Website

Currently the root domain has no site configured. Working through customisation of Docusaurus to hold documentation and become a centralized document repo for the manu projects I work on.

Docusaurus supports react native which is advantageous for development and seems to be a good framework to build off whilst learning Nodejs deployments and implementations.
